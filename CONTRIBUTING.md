# Hiddify-Manager Directory Structure
#### ```/common/```
This directory contains commonly used scripts for various tasks such as project installation, daily operations, firewall rule management, and more. These scripts provide essential functionality across different components of the project.

#### ```/haproxy/```
This directory contains installation/initialization/configuration scripts of the [HAProxy](https://www.haproxy.org/) project.

The Hiddify utilizes HAProxy as its primary traffic load balancer and routing tool.

There are several Jinja2 (.j2) files, which are HAProxy configuration files. These files are used based on the panel configuration settings.

#### Certificates
The panel issues the domains' certificates itself (Let's Encrypt, then ZeroSSL) and keeps them in its database
(`hiddifypanel/acme`); HAProxy answers the ACME challenges. nginx and acme.sh are deprecated (`services/deprecated/`).

#### ```/xray/```
This directory contains installation/initialization scripts of the [Xray-core](https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core).

The configs directory contains Xray's config files, which are Jinja2 (.j2) files. These config files are dynamically generated based on the panel configurations.

#### ```/singbox/```
This direcotry contails installation/initialization scripts of the [Sing-box](https://github.com/SagerNet/sing-box).

The configs directory contains Sing-box's config files, which are Jinja2 (.j2) files. These config files are dynamically generated based on the panel configurations.
